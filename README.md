## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ayberk
#### Iâ€™m a developer & designer and I love adapting new technologies into design.
#### Iâ€™ve been regaining my programming skills for the last 6 months after graduating from a design school and I'm blown away by the opportunities that the technologies I try to learn offer.
#### Iâ€™d be more than happy to collaborate!
