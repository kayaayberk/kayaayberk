- 👋 Hi, I’m Ayberk
- 👀 I’m a designer & developer and I love adapting new technologies into design.
- 🤓 I’ve been teaching myself programming for the last 5 months and I'm blown away by the opportunities that the technologies I try to learn offer.
- 💞️ I’d be more than happy to collaborate on any idea!
